Revenue Manager (backend)

Uses a PostgreSQL database.

//// Calculation:

cashflow = account.balance + (revenue - (operational_expenses + salary))

- Active tax check
Returned for every operation.

if (cashflow > 0) {
	tax.total = tax.total + ((tax_percents/cashflow) * 100)
} else {
	not taxable as the cashflow is negative, no profit to pay taxes.
}

- Yearly tax check
Will fetch all the calculations done for the year and compile it all into a single calculation
so taxes can be calculated for the corresponding year.

Formula is same as active tax checks, but instead of the cashflow variable, a variable that contains
all the calculations done in the year are used.
